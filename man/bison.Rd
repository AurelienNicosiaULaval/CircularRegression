\title{Bison movement data}
\format{
A data frame with \code{5,696} rows and 7 columns:
\describe{
  \item{y.dir}{Direction of movement at time \eqn{t}.}
  \item{y.prec}{Direction of movement at time \eqn{t-1}.}
  \item{y.prec2}{Direction of movement at time \eqn{t-2}.}
  \item{x.meadow}{Angle toward the nearest meadow.}
  \item{z.meadow}{Distance toward the nearest meadow associated with \code{x.meadow}.}
  \item{x.gap}{Angle toward the nearest canopy gap.}
  \item{z.gap}{Distance toward the nearest canopy gap associated with \code{x.gap}.}
}

\usage{
bison
}
\description{
A subset of the bison movement dataset used for illustrating angular
regression models of the form \eqn{y = x_1 + x_2:z_2 + \cdots}, where `x.*`
denote angular covariates (target directions) and `z.*` the corresponding
positive covariates (weights) in the product \code{x:z}. The data originate
from GPS-tracked bison trajectories and environmental variables describing
landscape features such as meadows and canopy gaps.
}
\details{
This reduced dataset is designed to work directly with the functions of the
\emph{CircularRegression} package implementing the general angular regression
model of Rivest et al. (2016). Each \code{x:z} pair represents a weighted
target direction contributing to the mean resultant vector
\eqn{\sum_j \beta_j z_j (\cos x_j, \sin x_j)}, where \code{z.*} modulates the
attraction toward the angular covariate \code{x.*}. Variables
\code{y.prec} and \code{y.prec2} can be included to model directional
persistence between successive movement steps.

Ecologically, these variables describe the orientation of bison movement
relative to attractive features in the landscape: open meadows and canopy
gaps. The dataset serves as a clean example for model testing, illustration,
and teaching applications involving directional movement analysis.
