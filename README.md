**CircularRegression** is an R package for performing regression analysis when the **response variable is circular** (e.g., angles, directions, time-of-day measured in radians). It provides estimation methods and visualization tools adapted to this unique data structure.

## âœ¨ Main Features

- `angular()` â€” fits a circular regression model
- `consensus()` â€” fits a circular regression model based on consensus errors
- `summary()`, `plot()`, `coef()`, `residuals()` â€” S3 methods for fitted models
- `data(bison)` â€” an example dataset for demonstration
