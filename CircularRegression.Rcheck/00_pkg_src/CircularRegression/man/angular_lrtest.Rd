\title{Likelihood-ratio test (T2) between two homogeneous angular models}
\usage{
angular_lrtest(full, reduced, check = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{full}{Object of class \code{"angular"} (full model).}

\item{reduced}{Object of class \code{"angular"} (nested reduced model).}

\item{check}{Logical; perform consistency checks.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"htest"}.
}
\description{
Computes the statistic from Rivest et al. (2016), Section 3.6:
\deqn{T_2 = 2 n \hat\kappa_1 (\bar C_1 - \bar C_0),}
where model 1 is the full model and model 0 the nested reduced model.
